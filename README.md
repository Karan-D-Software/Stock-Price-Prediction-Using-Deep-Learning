# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning
This project aims to develop a deep learning model to predict the future prices of SPY, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF, using historical stock price data. By applying advanced deep learning techniques such as LSTM networks, we aim to capture temporal patterns and trends to make accurate price predictions.
